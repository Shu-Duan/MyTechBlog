<h2 align="center">MyTechBlog</h2>

### WHY
After using Wordpress and Media I finally decided to create my own tech blog.
The followings are the reasons why I don't use those blogs any more.

#### 1. Theme
As a front-end developer I think my blog should be at least good-looking, but most of the blog provides few models with ver basic look or some of the models are charged. So if I create a blog by my own i can make it the way I like.

#### 2. Live code
The most needed feature of a tech blog must be live code. But unfortunally it is usually a charged feature in most blog. With live code, your readers can easily catch up with your example and it will really give a big hand to them. After reading styled-component website I find out a very useful open source -- react-live, So I would like to impletent it to my blog.

#### 3. Google Analytics
Some blog provide user monitor of analytics, for example: Wordpress. Not sure others have it or not, but I'm always curious about how many people visit my bog and how long do they actually stay. Having a blog built by my own, I can investigate my visitors and also learning how to buld a websibe with good practice of SEO.
